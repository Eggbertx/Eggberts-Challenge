# Eggbertx's Challenge
A port of Chip's Challenge to the miniSphere game engine

Note: For legal reasons, I can't distribute the official CHIPS.DAT file, 
so you'll need to provide that. This is still very unstable and doesn't fully work yet
so I can't guarantee that it will work at all with other .dat files, like Tile World.
Music goes in music/ and sounds go in sounds/ (duh).
